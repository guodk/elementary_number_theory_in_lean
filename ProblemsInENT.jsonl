Since we are assuming that $n > 1$, the induction starts with $n = 2$. As usual, this case is easy: the required factorisation is simply $n = 2^1$. Now assume that $n > 2$ and that every integer strictly between 1 and $n$ has a prime-power factorisation. If $n$ is prime then $n = n^1$ is the required factorisation of $n$, so we can assume that $n$ is composite, say $n = ab$ where $1 < a, b < n$. By the induction hypothesis, both $a$ and $b$ have prime-power factorisations, so by substituting these into the equation $n = ab$ and then collecting together powers of each prime $p_i$ we get a prime-power factorisation of $n$.

By permuting the prime-powers in the second factorisation we may assume that $j = 1$, so $p_1|q_1$. Since $q_1$ is prime, it follows that $p_1 = q_1$, so cancelling this prime from the two factorisations we get $p_1^{e_1-1} p_2^{e_2} \\dots p_k^{e_k} = q_1^{f_1-1} q_2^{f_2} \\dots q_l^{f_l}$.
